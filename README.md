IRIS BASED ATTENDENCE SYSTEM
# Introduction
Biometric authentication is a process of identifying an individual based on behavioral characteristics. The ophthalmologist Frank Burch in 1936 proposed the idea of pattern recognition for personal identification purpose. In 1980 the pattern recognition was used in the film of James Bond but it was miracle at that time. This process of pattern recognition was firstly developed by John Daugman. An iris system has a function of most secure identification. That is why it is the most popularly used recognition system. Uniqueness, stability, permanency are the features that makes the iris recognition system more popularly. It uses the images of iris which is taken from the camera for the unique identification.
# Description of Iris System:
Iris recognition verification is one of the most reliable personal identification methods in Biometrics. With the rapid development of iris recognition verification, Iris is present inside the eye and it is protected with different layers. System based biometrics and wireless technique solves the problem of spurious attendance. It can make the users' attendances more easily and effectively.
# TASK ANALYSIS:

# PATTERN MATCHING:
 This is the next step to the iris localization method. Bringing the recent iris pattern which is taken from the camera is then transferred into spatial alignment with a candidate data base which is already saved. An aligned iris pattern represents the distinctive apparent pattern. Evaluating the goodness of the iris and matching the pattern between the recent acquired image of iris and data base of iris representations. If the recently acquired image of iris and the saved images of iris in the data base were derived from the same iris; then the goodness of the iris is matched. The Iris Code which is derived from this process is compared with previously generated Iris Code which is referred as pattern matching. Using integer XOR logic, a long vector of each iris code is XORed to generate a new integer. Each bit shows the mismatch between the vectors being compared.

# TRANSMISSION USING WIRELESS TECHNIQUE:
There are mainly two kinds of iris recognition attendance management system in the market. On-line system may have power failure etc. so It will be easy with development of wireless such as WIFI, GPS, Mobile application etc.

# FUNCTIONS AND COMPOSING OF THE SYSTEM:
•	Take the task of users’ attendances. 
•	Transmit the information of attendances to the managing PC.
•	As a terminal of information, display useful information transmitted by PC on LCD.



# TRANSMISSION PROTOCOL DESIGN:
Transmission protocol design Uncertain outside factors may occur in wireless transmission such as electromagnetic interference, power and noise interference. So we must supply a wireless transmission protocol which can do error correcting and detecting effectively.

# CONTROLLING SOFTWARE DESIGN:
Attendances operations and system menu setting operations are carried out in keyboard processing program by the way of users or manager press keys to send keyboard interrupt message to system program. Operations of registering, deleting, modifying irises are in the system setting menu. Only manager has the right to enter system setting menu after verifying his/her iris recognition.

# METHOD:
 A typical iris recognition system generally consists of the following basic methods:
I.	Image acquisition, iris location, and pre-processing, 
II.	II. Iris texture feature extraction and signature encoding,  
III.	III. Iris signature matching for recognition or verification.

# CONCLUSION:
This system possess the functions of iris recognition, verifying, checking on attendances independently, and wireless communication and so on. The performance of this system meets the needs of daily attendance management in various enterprises and institutions. It has good market prospects. While the rapid development of chip and computer technologies, many new methods should be used in such system e.g. RFID technology.
